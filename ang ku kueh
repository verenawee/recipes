Ang Ku Kueh
(red tortoise cakes)
Ingredients
Green beans (shelled) - 150g (dry weight)
Sugar - 50g

Glutinous rice flour - 300g
Sugar - 15g (3 teaspoons)
Mulberry leaf matcha - 6g (3 teaspoons)
Water - 25ml
Coconut milk - 25ml
Pinch salt

Pandan or Banana leaf for steaming
Coconut oil

Instructions
A. Prepare filling
1. Wash, then soak beans overnight in water
2. Steam beans for 30 mins or till split, puffed and translucent yellow
3. Mash with sugar and mix till paste
4. Form balls

B. Prepare steaming rests
1. Wash, prep pandan or banana leafs (cutting to size)
2. Line steamer with leafs, giving some space for dough bloat.
3. Brush with coconut oil

C. Prepare skins
1. Mix thoroughly in a bowl - first 3 ingredients (glutinous rice flour, sugar, matcha)
2. Mix water, salt (may be warmish, not hot) and coconut milk in a cup
3. Mix wet ingredients into dry ingredient a little at a time while stirring with chopsticks until ingredients come together into a ball
4. The dough should not be crumbly. It should be pliable enough to form into a ball without breaking. Knead. Add more water if necessary.
5. Rest dough for 30mins - 1 hour.
6. Powder mould.
7. Wrap filling balls into skins (like dumplings)
8. Place in mould. Knock it out.
9. Place on steaming rests, brush with coconut oil.
10. Steam on medium-high to high heat till dough cooks (5-7 mins).
If you leave it too long it will bloat and stick to each other.


Special handling
A bit of “kee” (alkali) on the leaf and in the dough makes it more fragrant.
