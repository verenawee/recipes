Makes 1 standard loaf or 9 minis

3	large eggs
3/4	cup (175 grams) granulated sugar
1/2	cup (120 milliliters) heavy cream
6	tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed, plus extra for greasing
1	tablespoon poppy seeds
Finely grated zest of 3 lemons (1 tablespoon)
1 1/3	cups (170 grams) all-purpose flour
1 1/4	teaspoons baking powder
1/4	teaspoon salt

Heat the oven to 350° (180° C). 
Grease the loaf pan(s) and line with parchment paper, then set aside. 

Place the eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, until pale and frothy. 
Add the cream and continue to beat for about 2 minutes, until the mixture has combined, thickened a little, and turned pale.

In the meantime, melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat, stir in the poppy seeds and lemon zest, and set aside. 

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl, then use a rubber spatula to fold this into the egg mixture before folding in the butter, poppy seeds, and zest. 
Spoon the mixture into the loaf pan(s) so that it rises three-quarters of the way up the sides. 
Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 36 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. 

Set aside to cool for 30 minutes before removing from the pan. Leave to come to room temperature before serving.
